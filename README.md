# Clustering
The project involves segmenting customers into different groups based on their shopping trends.
The dataset is fetched from githubusercontent.com. Our dataset has five columns: CustomerID, Genre, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
First, we will apply hierarchical clustering and use dendrogram to help find the number of clusters within the data.
Next, applied hierarchical clustering based on the number of clusters you pick from the dendrogram, and visualized the results using scatterplot.
We also applied KMeans clustering to cluster the data and visualise the results.
